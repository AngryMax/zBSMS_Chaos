# Super Mario Sunshine Hyper Chaos Mod
A chaos mod for the BetterSMS Engine with 100 effects!

# Installation
Download the most recent release of the mod [here](https://github.com/AngryMax/zBSMS_Chaos/releases). Two methods of installation are provided:

### BetterSMS Module
If you would like to use a more modular approach (which allows allows for compatibility with mods like Eclipse), set up BetterSunshineEngine by following the directions [here](https://github.com/DotKuribo/BetterSunshineEngine), and then place the kxe file in your extracted ISO's directory /files/Kuribo!/Mods/.
NOTE: This mod was developed for v3.1 of BetterSunshineEngine, so compatibility with other versions may vary.

### ISO Patch
If you would like to simply patch the game like any other Sunshine mod, an xDelta file is provided. There are plenty of tutorials for how to patch xDelta files.

# Installing the Code Display script
An optional python script for displaying the active chaos effects is provided [here](https://github.com/MasterMattK/Hyper-Chaos-Code-Display). Installation and usage instructions are provided there.

# Devolopment Roadmap
Features you can expect in the next update(1.1):
* Seeded RNG for code selection + the ability to input custom seeds
* Important bug/crash fixes if needed
* Balance changes if needed
* Possibly other stuff
* No release date

After 1.1 is released, Hyper Chaos will become a backburner project. This means that in some unkown point in the future, there could be an update with extra/changed codes, new settings, livestream voting, etc. We also would like to add a system for enabling/disabling certain codes, but we've yet to find a practical way to pull that off.
